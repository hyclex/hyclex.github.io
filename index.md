I am a researcher with Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Montreal Research Center. I received my bachelor's degree at the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering in Huazhong University of Science and Technology and my PhD's degree at the Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering in the University of Alberta.

I always admire the insightful science or art achievements that result from the inspiration and perspiration of the people who have relentless pursuit of truth and beauty. 

I am interested in wide area of topics, from applicational scenarios on distributed systems, large scale recommender systems, machine learning to fundamental theoretical problems on optimization, approximation algorithms and complexity, general algorithms and computer science.

### Misc. 
1. [**Five in Row**](https://github.com/hyclex/five_in_row) I developed a python based board game five in row equipped with alpha-beta search algorithm. To evaluate the board value, I invented a simple hashing algorithm that convolves the connected pieces in each line segment of 5 points in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. It turns out the algorithm is so strong and it can beat me (I believe I should be with intermediate to advanced level in this game).
