**Here I am!!!**

As I set my mind to work in the industry instead of faculty, I set my mind to keep a blog to share something and make myself thinking serios towards some stuff. Currently, the blog is intended for the following purposes: 

* share some unpublished interesting ideas for work and my research
* record some technical details of some notable projects to help myself remember the odds and ends there and make it a reference for others
* keep some learning notes organized with my own understanding
* share some thought from my life

It is not that easy for me to set this site up as one who never tried to build up a site with pure code. Thanks to the elegant [jekyll][jekyll site] and my past experience in Latex, I have managed to gradually grasp the basic stuff for a self-managed and clear looking blog. 

Let it witness the growth of myself!
